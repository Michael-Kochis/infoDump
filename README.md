Python Neo4J Playbase

## Basic Description
For now, this is just me playing around with a Python front end that links to a Neo4J instance for the back end.
Started as a superhero database for Arrowverse, and ended up being a generic book/comic/TV/movie database
Haven't started the GUI (front end UI) work yet, so it's little better than using the Aura console.
Working on a Cypher statement builder, but casually (Don't expect big rapid improvements).

## Home Use
To use this on your own database, you will need to put the following into a .env file.

URI=<Your connection URI, from the Neo4J Console page, connection tab.>

N4USER=<Your user name>
  
N4PASS=<password for above account
