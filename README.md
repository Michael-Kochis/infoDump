Python Neo4J Playbase

For now, this is just me playing around with a Python front end that links to a Neo4J instance for the back end.
Started as a superhero database for Arrowverse, and ended up being a generic book/comic/TV/movie database
Haven't started the GUI (front end UI) work yet, so it's little better than using the Aura console.
Working on a Cypher statement builder, but casually (Don't expect big rapid improvements).
